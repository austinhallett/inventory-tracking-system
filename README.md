# inventory-tracking-system

This is a demo application that acts as a playground for me to experiment with new design patterns, and technologies. It is based on the application I created at Silicon Labs as I taught myself to code.

## Technologies

In this section I will highlight some of the key technologies that I have chosen to use in this repo and why they have peaked my interest.

### Bun

Bun is a new runtime for Javascript built in Zig and boast serious performance improvements as compared to Node.js. I rather enjoy working with the Javascript/Typescript ecosystem, so I am excited by Bun.

### Turborepo

Turbo repo is a monorepo management solution created by Vercel. There is something really compelling about a cohesive monorepo, so I want to try it out to determine if it improves my developer experience.

### Next.js

Next.js is a server-side react framework

### OpenTelemetry

Just as important as an application performance, is the monitoring tools. I want to experiment with using Prometheus to export metrics, logs, and traces.
